gnat v0.1
---------

A small audio collection tool to associate local audio files with semantic web URIs.

Gnat creates small RDF files in the folders of your music collection, such as :

/music
/music/Artist1
/music/Artist1/AlbumA/info_metadata.rdf
/music/Artist1/AlbumA/info_fingerprint.rdf
/music/Artist1/AlbumB/info_metadata.rdf
/music/Artist1/AlbumB/info_fingerprint.rdf

These can then be used by a tool such as gnarql[1] to expose this information through a SPARQL endpoint and allow futher information to be gathered about your collection.


USAGE
-----
- Track lookup based on local metadata :
./AudioCollection.py metadata /path/to/music

- Track lookup based on MusicDNS fingerprinting :
./AudioCollection.py fingerprint /path/to/music

- Clean all .rdf files :
./AudioCollection.py clean /path/to/music
