Examples for typical use cases
------------------------------

 trackuri.py
   Tries to find an URI for an audio file, using metadata lookup.

   WARNING: for the first track of an album, this may be a bit slow,
   due to the algorithm used. Then, trying to identify other tracks
   on the same album is faster.
